# QOptirun
A PyQT-based optirun frontend written in Python.

This is a project I'm currently working on and still needs the following before it's considered complete:
* Presets are not implemented yet
* A fix for an icon issue in the application list
* Checks for required deps and errors
* A (fully) working configuration
* Detecting if optirun doesn't exit correctly
* The ability to add and remove custom binaries (currently it uses the global apps list)
* Basic code cleanup and commenting

I will eventually get around to completing this however it is in a usable state currently and will allow you to run programs with optirun and select the bridge and vgl compression method you want. You can also close or kill the program from QOptirun if nessessary.
